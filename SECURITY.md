## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not report it through public GitHub issues.
Instead, please report it privately through the [Security tab](https://github.com/yusukehigasa/nth_weekday/security/advisories) 
or email the maintainer directly at higasa@studio-higasa.com.

When reporting, please include the following information if possible:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Affected versions
- Potential fix, if available

We will prioritize addressing reported vulnerabilities and will coordinate
the release of fixes with the reporter before making them public.
